Dear friends!

I teach with great passion and look forward to continuing this journey with you.

I obtained my diploma in concert guitar from the MDW, the former University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, under the guidance of Professor Walter Würdinger. Additionally, I have received instruction from renowned figures such as Paul Angerer, David Russell, Manuel Barrueco, Brigitte Zaczek, and Nicholas Goluses.

In addition to my daily guitar routine, I have taken on another project: the **proMúsica Studio**. My goal is to turn my space into a proper music haven.

I have utilized all the knowledge I have acquired over the past years about Linux and the open-source movement. I have installed and configured hardware and software, adjusted the acoustics in the room, and even completed this website. It's amazing what can be achieved with this technology.

**Recording** is, of course, a natural part of my teaching!

So, if you are equally passionate musicians or simply curious about cool projects, feel free to get in touch with me.
