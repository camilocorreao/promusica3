**Carlos Juan Busquiel** was born in 1980 and began playing the guitar at the age of 12, although he also completed violin studies at the Conservatory. Later, he studied music and English at the **University of Alicante** and worked as a teacher for nine years.

His **interest in instrument making** began when he ventured into building an electric guitar on his own. This introduced him to the world of instrument making. He also built an acoustic violin following the model of Stradivari. Through an encounter with the guitar maker **Rafael López Porras** in Cádiz, he was introduced to the art of guitar making. Later, he studied with master **José Luis Romanillos** and developed the concept of the "Spanish guitar" based on traditional construction methods of **Antonio de Torres**.

Busquiel also had the opportunity to study valuable instruments by historical builders. Based on this knowledge, he developed various guitar models appreciated by guitarists worldwide.
