"For almost four decades, I have been building guitars and passionately exploring the history and development of this wonderful instrument. It is a crucial moment for me in the evolution of the guitar.

I have been fortunate to meet many personalities in the world of classical guitar, although I consider myself self-taught in guitar construction. I find the current era, where the exchange of information on the internet facilitates learning, historically significant. It allows me to appreciate the work of international builders and complete my education in guitar construction.

My current focus is on new construction techniques for Spanish classical guitars and the innovations that have influenced the preferences of professional musicians. My entire dedication is to those individuals who, through their effort, discipline, and sensitivity, make the magic and miracle of music possible."
