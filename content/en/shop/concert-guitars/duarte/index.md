He describes himself as self-taught, exploring guitar construction through a trial-and-error method. He received his initial instructions in making guitars from the luthier León Vargas in Medellín. Since then, Miguel has supplemented his knowledge through the internet and by reaching out to other South American luthiers, particularly those in Argentina.

Miguel builds two types of guitars:

- Classical traditional guitars, but also incorporating carbon fiber, and the
- Australian model: Lattice.

Miguel constructs approximately 10 to 12 guitars per year, and he does so alone, without any assistance.

As a reference, I invite you to listen to recordings by the Twins Katona duo using two Lattice model guitars made by Miguel Duarte.
