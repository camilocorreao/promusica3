The highest model in Aparicio's Standard Series, the AA50 features laminated Indian rosewood back and sides and a high-quality spruce top. An excellent choice for the serious student.  At this price it's better than getting a Cordoba or any classical guitar at guitar center of a similar price. Made in Valencia, Spain.
