The Multiac Grand Concert SA features pristine-sounding electronics by LR Baggs. Similarly to other Multiac Grand Concert models, the guitar’s design unites a larger body with a Solid Cedar top and a neck that joins the body at the twelfth fret. The 2″ nut width is slightly larger than the standard Multiac and more typical of the classical tradition. The result is the ultimate guitar for classical players who require an amplified sound.
