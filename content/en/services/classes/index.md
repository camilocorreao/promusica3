- It's best if you come to my studio and learn directly from me about the nature and style of my lessons.

- We can discuss the price. Normally, it's €45 for a 50-minute lesson. However, for me, enthusiasm and dedication are more important.

- If you don't have a guitar, I can lend you one for the duration of your lessons with me.

- I teach in Vienna 2, at Böcklinstrasse 100, and also in 3400 Klosterneuburg, at Doppelngasse 94/9.

- Give me a call to arrange a meeting. I'm looking forward to it.
