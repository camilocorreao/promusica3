The **easy playability** is definitely a prerequisite for a successful learning process. Also, the quality of the strings plays an important role.

Therefore:

- we prepare the desired guitar before your visit,
- we provide **new strings** and
- check the **playability**.

After your test, we can still have your instrument adjusted to your needs by our professional guitar maker.

- Adjustment for easy playability: nut and bridge readjustment
- Desired strings, brand, and material for classical guitar: nylon or carbon strings.

Call me or send me a message with your information and preferred appointment.
